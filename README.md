This is your mission….should you choose to accept it….

The booming metropolis of Loop City needs your help! The city's main website is down and no one can figure out how to fix it. They've called in reinforcements from Kodeden to figure out how to fix the citizen list.

Use your knowledge of loops to loop through the list of citizens and display the names on the screen. This challenge contains concepts that we have yet to see so far in the program. There is some code already provided, and it's up to you to write the loop.


*THE GOAL*

All names in the citizens array should be listed in an ordered list on the screen. Once you come to a solution, add more names to the array to see your loop update dynamically and display the new names!

This challenge will test your ability to use your researching skills to find out more information on topics that you may not be familiar with. Remember…. read all of the instructions, comb through the existing code, use Google to search for answers, implement a solution, and then and ONLY then, ask for help. This is the best way to learn!

YOU CAN DO THIS! Loop City needs you.
